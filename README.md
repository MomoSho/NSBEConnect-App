# NSBEConnect-App
Problem:  Suppose that NSBEconnect website disappeared from the World Wide Web 2hours ago. There  are no backups and it will take too long to create another website. The NSBE world is in a frantic and  counting on you guys to fix it. You have roughly 12 hours to create a mobile platform that can take the  place of NSBEconnect. Remember this platform has to be mission based "to increase the number of  culturally responsible Black Engineers who excel academically, succeed professionally and positively  impact the community." Your hack must include:  ● User Interface  ● User Profiles (Create/Sign in)  ● Registration for Events  ● Map of nearby users  It will be up to your team to decide the other main features. Remember you want to stand out from  the rest. Hint NSBE love to run reports and compile stats. Features does not have to be fully functional  but present.
